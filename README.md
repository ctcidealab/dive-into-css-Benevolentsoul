# CSS starter for DevCamp Level 1
Starting CSS and HTML for day two of DevCamp level one. This should include:
* an HTML file named ```learn_css.html```, dealing largely with cats.
* a CSS file named ```style.css```, for styling the aforementioned cat-related page.
* a pair of HTML and CSS files, both named ```position``` for learning about CSS positioning.
* that's about it.
